# style_transfer
Neural style transfer using tensorflow

## What the project is about
Taking the style of one image and content of another image, we get a resultant image. This is done by pretrained model from TensorFlow-Hub which uses Convolutional Neural Networks for this style transfer.

For example, you can take a photo of the apartment you live in, suppose you want to imagine what the apartment whould look like if drawn by Mozart. For this the content image will be your apartment photo and the style image will be a picture of any painting that you deem suitable from Mozart.

## Credits for this neural style transfer algorithm
First published in the paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" by Leon Gatys et al., originally released to ArXiv 2015, and subsequently accepted by the peer-reviewed CVPR conference in 2016.
